Approved by many fans of Sonic.

## NOTE:
The performance might start to tank when a hefty amount of rings are active. There's nothing I can do about that. Suffer.

## the botnet says: 
Sonic rings are now available in FiveM! This mod adds in the classic rings from the Sonic franchise, so you can add a little bit of nostalgia to your game, and it's sure to please any Sonic fans that may be playing on your server.
